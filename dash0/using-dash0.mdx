import { Frame } from "mintlify/components";

After you have successfully logged in to Dash0, you will be automatically redirected to the appropriate views.

If you are not sending data yet, Dash0 will open the onboarding page, which provides guidance how to send data, or easy access to the built-in OpenTelemetry demo application for playing with Dash0 while you are setting up your own applications.

The main starting point into Dash0 will be the Resource Table if you are already sending data.
