## Introduction
We have created [onboarding screens](https://app.dash0.com/onboarding) within Dash0 that provide all the information required to send data. The screens include instructions for sending data from various platforms, runtime environments, and programming languages. They can be accessed anytime using the URL: [https://app.dash0.com/onboarding](https://app.dash0.com/onboarding).
<Note>
If user- and environment-specific settings need to be defined, the examples in the onboarding screens already contain your specific information (e.g., endpoints and access tokens).
</Note>

## Settings
Information for sending data to Dash0 can be found in the "manage" section of your [organization](https://www.dash0.com/documentation/dash0/key-concepts/organizations).

An authorization token needs to be specified to send data to Dash0. The configuration can be accessed by clicking on the Organization Switcher in the top left corner and selecting "manage."

Dash0 offers various endpoints for sending data. The appropriate endpoint can be found in the manage section, too.
